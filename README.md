# CompSciAI202002
Slides and materials for U of A CompSci AI club seminar

The Google slides `Embedded Machine Learning` provide all the main details to train and deploy a speech recognition ("wake word") model to an microcontroller platfrom. The specific example is for the Artemis module/board.

The Jupyter notebook `CompSciAITF115.ipynb` is lightly documented to walk through training a small model. Other model architectures can be tried to be sure, so whack away!

The speech data set is [speech_commands](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mok0na/speech-commands-v002)
